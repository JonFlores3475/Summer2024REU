% Introduction Section
\section{Introduction}
Have you ever been so lonely at night and wish to talk to someone? Well, Our Friend, a chat bot is here to cure your lonesome.
The chatbot listens to your hopes, dreams, concerns and thoughts.
Via Discord, you have the ability to communicate with the chatbot. Not only is it a great listener,
but it provides mediocre advice. As the user, you input some words, and Our Friend, a chat bot,
responds in a nice and caring way (unless you piss it off). It really cares about you and makes you
have someone to listen and talk to you (if you don't piss it off).

% Language Overview Proposal
\section{Language Overview Proposal}
For the first aspect of our Python project, we are in charge of presenting the Python language to the
class. In order to teach the class about Python, we as a group are going to make an awesome movie for
the class to watch. In the movie, all four of us group members will be teaching the language fundamentals
and history. In the movie, we will reenact the development of Python. In addition, we will demonstrate
how Python is interactive and object-oriented \parencite[see][]{GeneralPython}. In the movie, we will discuss languages that relate to Python
and relate parts of Python back to topics learned in class. We will make sure to include how Python incorporates
dynamic typing and high-level dynamic data types. To include links about Python, we will post our movie on
YouTube and provide a GitHub repository with some coding examples as well as websites that provide Python
specifications, official documents, and tutorials.

% Programming Assignment Proposal
\section{Programming Assignment Proposal}
\subsection{Project Proposal}
For the second aspect of the Python project, we as a group have decided to work on a machine learning robot 
that will respond differently to the prompts given to it. We will call this our chatbot, and some of the problems 
include how it responds to different prompts. This is a good application for the language because Python is the 
language used for machine learning. We will include tests to determine that the program does what we claim it does. 

For the project management, we will divide the different tasks into groups where Adam and Ashley will mainly be 
responsible for getting the chatbot up and running, and Gabby and Zeke will be responsible for the layout and frontend 
development. This project will be started after spring break and break it into sizable chunks. Every week, the 
group will meet for one or two hours to plan on what we need next to complete the project on time. 

\subsection{Project Evaluation}
To evaluate the chatbot that is going to be created, there will be some tests that will be implemented including 
accuracy, precision, response time, and user satisfaction. After testing how the chatbot can respond, there 
will be evaluation data that will be predetermined questions and the expected response from the chatbot. 

% Presentation Proposal
\section{Presentation Proposal}
To present our language to the class, we will provide a detailed presentation of our chat bot. The detailed
presentation will provide a walkthrough of how the chatbot works and the awesome features of the bot.
We as a group will both work on the movie together and the actual Python program. Gabby and Zeke will work on
the main parts of the GUI and frontend development, while Adam and Ashley will focus on the backend aspects of
the chatbot.
When we present the whole project, we will first play our movie to the class. Afterwards, we will
walk through the super epic chatbot we made. When we present Our Friend, a chatbot, we will first show some examples
of the features it includes. Once we show the user's point of view, we will walk through our code and how we made it do
what it does.
